# Figma Flutter MCP: Why We Don't Rely Solely on Figma API
This is a detailed doc about why we didn't fork existing [Figma Context MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP) or didn't rely on Figma's API alone.

## Overview

This project uses a **hybrid approach** that combines Figma API data extraction with intelligent analysis and Flutter-specific guidance generation. We deliberately avoid relying entirely on Figma's API endpoints for several critical reasons.

## The Problem with Pure Figma API Approach

### 1. **Published Resources Limitation**

Figma's API has significant limitations when it comes to accessing design resources:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Figma API only returns PUBLISHED resources
GET /v1/files/{file_key}/styles
// Returns: Only published color styles, text styles, effects

GET /v1/files/{file_key}/components  
// Returns: Only published components from libraries
```

**Reality Check:**
- Most internal design work is **NOT published**
- Designers often work with local styles and components
- Publishing requires additional workflow steps that many teams skip
- Internal/confidential projects cannot be published publicly

### 2. **Dev Mode Requirement**

Figma's Dev Resources endpoints provide richer data but come with restrictions:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Requires Dev Mode subscription
GET /v1/files/{file_key}/dev_resources
// Returns: Detailed component specs, but only with Dev Mode access
```

> NOTE: This is what [Figma Context MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP) uses. That's an additional reason we need a different approach.

**Barriers:**
- **Dev Mode is a paid feature** - not available to all users
- **Freelancers and small teams** often don't have Dev Mode access
- **Client projects** may not provide Dev Mode access to external developers
- **Educational/personal projects** can't justify the cost

### 3. **Framework Agnostic vs Flutter Specific**

Figma's API returns generic design tokens and specifications:

```json
{
  "fills": [{"type": "SOLID", "color": {"r": 0.2, "g": 0.4, "b": 0.8}}],
  "effects": [{"type": "DROP_SHADOW", "radius": 4, "offset": {"x": 2, "y": 2}}]
}
```

This requires **additional translation** to Flutter-specific implementations:

```dart
// Manual translation needed:
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Color.fromRGBO(51, 102, 204, 1.0),
    boxShadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        offset: Offset(2, 2),
        blurRadius: 4,
        color: Colors.black26,
      )
    ],
  ),
)
```

## Our Hybrid Solution

### 1. **Direct Node Access**

We use Figma's basic node API to access **any design**, regardless of publication status:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Works with ANY Figma file (public or private)
GET /v1/files/{file_key}/nodes?ids={node_ids}
// Returns: Complete node structure with all properties
```

**Benefits:**
- Access to **unpublished designs**
- Works with **internal/confidential projects**
- No Dev Mode requirement
- Real design data, not just published libraries

### 2. **Intelligent Analysis Layer**

Instead of relying on Figma's interpretation, we analyze the raw node data:

```typescript
// Our intelligent analysis
function detectSemanticType(content: string, nodeName: string): SemanticType {
  // Detects: button, heading, body, link, error, success, etc.
  // Based on content analysis, not just Figma's classification
}

function generateFlutterTextWidget(textInfo: TextInfo): string {
  // Generates Flutter-specific widget suggestions
  // Considers semantic meaning, not just visual properties
}
```

**Advantages:**
- **Semantic understanding** of design intent
- **Flutter-optimized** suggestions
- **Context-aware** recommendations
- **Handles edge cases** that Figma API misses

### 3. **Flutter-First Approach**

Our output is specifically tailored for Flutter development:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Flutter-specific guidance
guidance += `Container(\n`;
guidance += `  decoration: BoxDecoration(\n`;
guidance += `    color: Color(0xFF${fill.hex.substring(1)}),\n`;
guidance += `    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(${cornerRadius}),\n`;
guidance += `  ),\n`;
```

**vs Generic Figma API:**
```json
{
  "cornerRadius": 8,
  "fills": [{"color": {"r": 0.2, "g": 0.4, "b": 0.8}}]
}
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Universal Accessibility**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Any Figma Design] --> B[Our Hybrid Extractor]
    B --> C[Flutter Guidance]
    
    D[Published Libraries] -.-> E[Figma API Styles]
    E -.-> F[Generic Tokens]
    F -.-> G[Manual Translation]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#ffecb3
    style G fill:#ffcdd2
```

**Our Approach:**
- ‚úÖ Works with **any Figma file**
- ‚úÖ No publishing requirements
- ‚úÖ No Dev Mode needed
- ‚úÖ Direct Flutter output

**Pure API Approach:**
- ‚ùå Only published resources
- ‚ùå Requires Dev Mode for detailed specs
- ‚ùå Generic, framework-agnostic output
- ‚ùå Additional translation layer needed

### 2. **Real-World Compatibility**

| Scenario | Pure Figma API | Our Hybrid Approach |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Internal Company Designs** | ‚ùå Not published | ‚úÖ Full access |
| **Freelancer Projects** | ‚ùå No Dev Mode | ‚úÖ Works perfectly |
| **Client Confidential Work** | ‚ùå Cannot publish | ‚úÖ Private access |
| **Personal/Learning Projects** | ‚ùå Cost prohibitive | ‚úÖ Free to use |
| **Rapid Prototyping** | ‚ùå Requires setup | ‚úÖ Instant analysis |

### 3. **Flutter Optimization**

```typescript
// Our approach generates Flutter-ready code
if (textInfo.semanticType === 'button') {
  return `ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // TODO: Implement ${textInfo.content} action
    },
    child: Text('${textInfo.content}'),
  )`;
}

// vs Figma API generic response
{
  "type": "TEXT",
  "characters": "Click Me",
  "fills": [...]
}
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. **Extraction Phase**
```typescript
// Direct node access - works with any design
const node = await figmaService.getNode(fileId, nodeId);

// Extract comprehensive data
const analysis = {
  metadata: extractMetadata(node),
  layout: extractLayoutInfo(node),
  styling: extractStylingInfo(node),
  text: extractTextInfo(node),
  children: analyzeChildren(node)
};
```

### 2. **Analysis Phase**
```typescript
// Intelligent semantic analysis
const semanticType = detectSemanticType(text.content, node.name);
const deviceType = detectDeviceType(dimensions);
const sectionType = detectSectionType(node);

// Flutter-specific optimizations
const flutterGuidance = generateFlutterGuidance(analysis);
```

### 3. **AI Consumption Phase**
```typescript
// Structured output for AI consumption
return {
  designData: analysis,
  flutterGuidance: guidance,
  assetInfo: exportedAssets,
  implementationSuggestions: suggestions
};
```

## What We DON'T Do vs What We DO

### ‚ùå **What We DON'T Do:**
- **Create `.dart` files** - We don't generate actual Flutter code files

- **Community feedback welcome** - Your input helps improve the tool
- **Production use** - Test thoroughly before using in critical projects

### üí° **Optimization Tips**
- **Better prompts = Better results** - Be specific about what you want to analyze
- **Detailed requests** - "Analyze this login form component" vs "Analyze this"
- **Context matters** - Mention the component type, expected behavior, or specific concerns
- **Iterative refinement** - Use inspection tools first, then detailed analysis

### üìù **Example of Good vs Poor Prompts**

**‚ùå Poor Prompt:**
```
Analyze this Figma link: https://figma.com/...
```

**‚úÖ Good Prompt:**
```
Analyze this login form component from Figma: https://figma.com/...
Focus on the input field styling, button states, and form validation patterns.
I need Flutter widgets for a mobile app with Material Design.
```

## Conclusion

Our hybrid approach solves real-world problems that pure Figma API solutions cannot address:

1. **Accessibility**: Works with any Figma file, regardless of publication status
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: No premium subscriptions required
3. **Flutter-first**: Optimized specifically for Flutter development
4. **Intelligence**: Semantic analysis beyond basic API data
5. **Practicality**: Handles real-world design workflows
