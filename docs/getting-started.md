## üé® Setting Up Theme Colors

The most efficient way to generate Flutter themes is to create a dedicated theme frame in Figma.

### Create Your Theme Frame

1. **In Figma**: Create a frame with your color palette
2. **Organize colors** by purpose (primary, secondary, background, etc.)
3. **Add labels** to identify each color's purpose

![Theme Setup Example](images/theme-frame.png)

### Get the Figma Link

**Figma Desktop**: 
- Select your theme frame
- Press `Cmd + L` (or `Ctrl + L`)

**Figma Web**: 
- Select your theme frame  
- Copy the URL from your browser

### Generate Flutter Theme

Use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Setup Flutter theme from <figma_link> including all colors. 
Create a comprehensive ColorScheme and ThemeData that follows Material Design 3 principles.
Organize the colors by their semantic meaning (primary, secondary, surface, etc.).
```

**Example Result**: You'll get a complete Flutter theme with:
- `ColorScheme` with proper semantic color assignments
- `ThemeData` configuration
- Custom color extensions if needed
- Usage examples for each color

## ‚úçÔ∏è Setting Up Typography

Create a typography system that matches your design language.

### Create Your Typography Frame

1. **In Figma**: Create a frame with text samples
2. **Include different styles**: Headlines, body text, captions, etc.
3. **Show hierarchy**: H1, H2, H3, body, small text
4. **Add style names** for clarity

![Typography Setup Example](images/text-style-frame.png)

### Get the Figma Link

Same process as theme colors - select the frame and copy the link.

### Generate Flutter Typography

Use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Setup Flutter typography theme from <figma_link>. 
Create a complete TextTheme with all the text styles shown.
Include font weights, sizes, and letter spacing that match the design.
Provide usage examples for each text style.
```

**Example Result**: You'll get:
- Complete `TextTheme` configuration
- Proper Material Design text style assignments
- Custom text styles if your design uses unique typography
- Code examples showing how to use each style

## üß© Single Widget Creation

Convert individual Figma components into reusable Flutter widgets.

### Best Practices for Widget Design

1. **Use Figma Components** when possible (creates variants automatically)
2. **Name your components** descriptively 
3. **Create variants** for different states (enabled/disabled, light/dark)
4. **Include all interactive states**

![Button Component Example](images/button.png)

### Get the Component Link

**For Components**:
- Select the component or component set
- Copy the link (`Cmd + L` or `Ctrl + L`)

**For Frames** (if you don't have components):
- Select any frame you want to convert to a widget
- Copy the link

### Generate Flutter Widget

Use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Create this widget in Flutter from <figma_link>. 
Include 2-3 main variants and break the code into smaller, readable files.
Make it a reusable component with proper state management.
Include documentation and usage examples.
```

**Example Result**: You'll get:
- Main widget file with clean, readable code
- Separate files for complex sub-components
- Proper state management (StatefulWidget if needed)
- Variant handling (different styles/states)
- Documentation and usage examples
- Proper Flutter best practices

### Advanced Widget Prompts

**For Complex Components**:
```
Analyze this complex component from <figma_link>. 
Break it down into smaller sub-widgets for better maintainability.
Include proper state management and animation support where appropriate.
```

**For Component Sets with Many Variants**:
```
Create this component set from <figma_link> with all variants.
Use enums for variant selection and ensure type safety.
Optimize for performance and reusability.
```

## üì± Full Screen Generation

Convert entire Figma screens into complete Flutter screens with proper structure.

### Prepare Your Screen Design

1. **Use Frames** for full screens
2. **Include navigation elements** (app bars, bottom navigation)
3. **Add realistic content** (not just placeholder text)
4. **Consider responsive design** for different screen sizes

### Get the Screen Link

- Select the main screen frame
- Copy the Figma link

### Generate Flutter Screen

Use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Create a complete Flutter screen from this Figma design: <figma_link>
Ensure the code is well-organized with smaller, readable files.
Include proper navigation structure and responsive design.
Export any image assets automatically.
```

**Example Result**: You'll get:
- Main screen file with `Scaffold` structure
- Separate widget files for complex sections
- Proper navigation setup (AppBar, BottomNavigationBar, etc.)
- Responsive design considerations
- Automatic image asset export to `assets/` folder
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with asset references
- Clean, maintainable code structure

### Advanced Screen Prompts

**For Complex Layouts**:
```
Analyze this complex screen layout from <figma_link>.
Create a responsive design that works on both mobile and tablet.
Use proper Flutter layout widgets and ensure good performance.
```

**For Screens with Navigation**:
```
Create this screen from <figma_link> with proper navigation integration.
Include route definitions and navigation logic.
Ensure it fits well within a larger app structure.
```

**For Data-Driven Screens**:
```
Convert this screen from <figma_link> into a Flutter screen.
Make it data-driven with proper model classes and state management.
Include loading states and error handling.
```

## üí° Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. **Be Specific in Your Prompts**

‚ùå **Vague**: "Convert this Figma design"
‚úÖ **Specific**: "Create a reusable login form widget from this Figma component with validation states"

### 2. **Mention Your Requirements**

- Target platform (mobile, web, desktop)
- State management preference (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc)
- Design system (Material 3, Cupertino, custom)
- Performance considerations

### 3. **Iterative Refinement**

Start with basic conversion, then refine:
```
1. "Convert this basic button from <figma_link>"
2. "Add animation and haptic feedback to the button"
3. "Make it accessible with proper semantics"
```

### 4. **Asset Management**

- **Images**: Automatically exported with screen generation
- **SVGs**: Export separately using: `"Export this as SVG asset from <figma_link>"`
- **Icons**: Consider using Flutter's built-in icons or icon fonts

### 5. **Code Organization**

Always request:
- Separate files for complex components
- Proper folder structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Documentation and comments
